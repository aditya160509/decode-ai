  "title": "GreenScope – Urban Air Quality Dashboard",
  "topic": "Environment & Sustainability Batch",
  "difficulty": "★★★★☆ – combines real-time API + forecasting.",
  "goal": "Build a live dashboard that tracks AQI trends, visualizes pollutant composition, and predicts next-day air quality.",
  "why_it_matters": "Air pollution data exists but isn’t visualized in a way that helps people act on it.",
  "users": "Citizens, researchers, environment clubs.",
  "data": "OpenAQ API, local weather data, satellite air quality indexes.",
  "ai": [
    "Time-series forecasting (Prophet / LSTM) for next-day AQI prediction.",
    "Anomaly detection for sudden spikes."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Collect hourly AQI and weather feeds.",
    "Normalize pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, CO).",
    "Predict upcoming AQI trends.",
    "Display map + chart dashboards with safe-hour highlights."
  ],
  "outcome": "Demonstrates ML forecasting + civic visualization; highly relevant sustainability app."
