    "Rule-based Bayesian inference or RandomForest on symptom vectors.",

  "workflow": [
    "User selects or types symptoms.",
    "Model matches top 3 possible causes.",
    "Outputs next steps (“See GP”, “Hydration first”)."

  "outcome": "Great showcase of rule-based AI + responsible decision logic."
