  "topic": "Civic & Governance Batch",
  "difficulty": "★★★★☆ – heavy geospatial layer + API integration.",
  "goal": "Visualize all public projects on an interactive map with cost and stage info.",
  "why_it_matters": "Citizens rarely know how infrastructure funds are distributed spatially.",
  "users": "City planners, journalists, students.",
  "data": "Infrastructure project datasets, budgets, GPS coordinates.",
  "ai": [
    "Geospatial clustering; optional anomaly detection (budget per capita)."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Merge project CSVs and coordinates.",
    "Geocode locations; compute cost-per-zone metrics.",
    "Cluster and render interactive map.",
    "Filter by department, cost, or progress."
  ],
  "outcome": "Perfect for front-end + data-engineering synergy demo."
