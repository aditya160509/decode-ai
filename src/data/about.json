    "body": "DecodeAI is a student-built space designed to make learning AI, GitHub, and prompt engineering feel simple, connected, and real. When I first started exploring AI, everything was scattered across random tutorials and videos, and piecing it together was frustrating. I built DecodeAI to give students one clear place to begin. The goal is to help early learners understand AI by doing, not memorizing. Here you can learn core ideas, try interactive demos, and build meaningful projects that add real value to your portfolio, with peers learning alongside you.",

DecodeAI grew from my need for structured, beginner-friendly resources that still felt practical. I realized many students like me want to start early. They want to build, explore, and experiment but often do not know where to begin. DecodeAI became a launchpad for students to explore AI and no-code tools, understand how prompt engineering works, and see real projects in action. It is simple by design, personal in tone, and keeps improving with feedback from other student builders.",
